## üîç Technical Implementation

### Form Validation
```typescript
// Dynamic schema selection based on role
const getSchema = () => {
  if (selectedRole === "educator") return educatorSchema;
  if (selectedRole === "mentor") return mentorSchema;
  return studentSchema;
};
```

### Type Safety
```typescript
type StudentFormData = z.infer<typeof studentSchema>;
type EducatorFormData = z.infer<typeof educatorSchema>;
type MentorFormData = z.infer<typeof mentorSchema>;
type AllFormData = StudentFormData | EducatorFormData | MentorFormData;
```

### Role-Based Routing
```typescript
// Success page redirect
<Link href={`/dashboard/${selectedRole}`}>
  <Button size="lg">Get Started</Button>
</Link>
```
