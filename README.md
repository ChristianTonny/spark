**Know yourself. Try careers. Meet mentors. All before you commit your life.**

## The Problem We're Solving

**Right now, thousands of Rwandan students are gambling their futures on guesswork.**

Here's what happens:
- **Age 16:** "What do you want to be?"
- **Age 18:** Pick a major based on what parents want, what pays well, or what friends are doing
- **Age 22:** Graduate and take the first job you can find
- **Age 30:** Realize you hate it. But you have bills. You're stuck.

### Two Critical Failures:

**1. Students Don't Understand Themselves**
- Don't know what they're actually good at (vs. what they think they're good at)
- Don't know what they truly enjoy (vs. what seems impressive)
- Don't know what careers even exist locally (How many know what a UX designer or data analyst does?)

**Result:** Students pick careers based on guesses, not data. Like choosing a marriage partner without ever dating.

**2. Students Have Nobody to Talk To**
- Parents push what worked in their generation (doctor, lawyer, engineer)
- Friends are equally confused
- Teachers know education, not careers
- Google shows American salaries that don't match Rwandan reality

**Result:** Students make the biggest decision of their lives in complete isolation.

### Why This Matters

Wasted talent is a national crisis. 
- Brilliant developers stuck in accounting because "tech is too hard"
- Natural teachers trapped in marketing because "teaching doesn't pay"
- Incredible designers in administration because "creative careers aren't real"

**The cost?**
- **Personal:** A lifetime of mediocrity instead of mastery
- **Economic:** Rwanda loses talent it needs to build the next generation
- **Societal:** Another generation doing jobs they hate

We can't afford this.

## How OpportunityMap Solves This

We built the tool we wish we had at 18. Three core solutions:

### 1. **Help You Understand Yourself** (20 minutes)

Not a BuzzFeed quiz. A science-backed assessment combining:
- **Interest profiling** (RIASEC - used by career counselors worldwide for 50+ years)
- **Personality assessment** (Big Five - the most validated framework)
- **Values discovery** (What matters to you: impact vs. income, freedom vs. stability)
- **Work style analysis** (Do you lead, collaborate, or work independently?)

**Output:** Top 25 career matches with specific reasons why they fit you.

**Real example:**
> *"UX Designer (94% match) - Your investigative + artistic interests align perfectly. This career values creative freedom (your #1 priority) and offers 30-60M RWF salary in Rwanda. You'd solve user problems through design—matches your preference for small team collaboration."*

### 2. **Try Careers Before You Commit** (5 minutes per career)

**Reality Check Quizzes** - Interactive scenarios showing what the job is *actually* like.

**Example for Software Developer:**
> *"It's 6 PM Friday. Your code broke production. 1,000 users can't access the app. Your manager is calling. Your friends are waiting. What do you do?"*

After 7 scenarios, you get:
- **Readiness score** (0-100%)
- **6-dimensional analysis** (technical fit, pressure handling, collaboration style, creativity, independence, work-life balance)
- **Honest insights** from real professionals
- **Clear recommendation** (Strong Fit / Potential Fit / Consider Alternatives)

**Why this is magic:**
- It's honest - Shows reality, not the Instagram version
- It's interactive - You *feel* what the job is like
- It prevents costly mistakes - Better to discover incompatibility in 5 minutes than 5 years

### 3. **Connect You to People Who've Been There** (15 minutes)

Every career recommendation links to real Rwandan professionals who:
- Work in that field right now
- Will talk to you for 15 minutes
- Can answer: "What's it actually like?" "How did you get started?" "Is this what I think it is?"

**No more guessing. Talk to someone doing the job.**

## What Makes Us Different

### The Landscape
Career guidance platforms exist globally and across Africa:

**In Rwanda:**
- **Talent Match, Career Meeg** - Focus on job placement and workshops AFTER you've chosen a career
- **University career centers** - Only for enrolled students, doesn't scale, traditional counseling

**In Africa:**
- **Career Buddy (SA), CareerLead AI (Ghana), Yenza (SA)** - Generic assessments, no local mentors, AI chatbots instead of humans
- **The Student Hub (Uganda)** - B2B model selling to schools, 60K+ students but no public mentor network

**Globally:**
- **16Personalities** - Fun test but pseudoscience (Myers-Briggs), zero local context
- **80,000 Hours** - World-class research but only for elite university grads wanting "high-impact" careers
- **Forage** - Virtual internships (brilliant!) but corporate-focused, no assessment, no Rwanda content
- **LinkedIn** - Great for networking, terrible for career discovery

### Our Differentiation

**OpportunityMap is the only platform that combines:**

1. **Scientific Assessment** - RIASEC (50+ years of validation) + Big Five personality + Values + Work Style
2. **Reality Check Quizzes** - Experience careers through real scenarios in 5 minutes (like Forage but faster and broader)
3. **Local Professional Network** - Talk to actual Rwandan professionals (not AI chatbots)
4. **Rwanda-Specific Data** - Salaries in RWF, local career paths, professionals who work here
5. **Full Journey Coverage** - Self-discovery → Career exploration → Reality testing → Human guidance
6. **Free for Students** - Funded by mentor marketplace, not student wallets

**The Honest Truth:**
- We're not the only career platform in Africa
- We're not the only one with assessments
- We're not the only one with mentors

**But we're the only one built specifically for Rwanda that solves the ENTIRE journey—from "I don't know myself" to "I've talked to someone doing the job and tried what it's actually like."**

Everyone else solves pieces. We solve the whole problem.

## The Vision

Imagine a world where:
- Every 18-year-old in Rwanda takes 20 minutes to scientifically understand their strengths
- Career decisions are based on data, not pressure from parents
- Students can try careers and talk to professionals before committing years of their life
- Nobody wakes up at 35 realizing they wasted their potential

**That's the world we're building.**

---

## Why Now?

**Talent is everywhere. Opportunity is not.**

Rwanda has brilliant young minds who could build the next generation of technology, education, healthcare, and business. But most will never discover what they're truly capable of because they don't have:
1. Tools to understand themselves scientifically
2. Ways to experience careers before committing
3. Access to mentors who've walked the path

With OpportunityMap, **they won't need luck. They'll have data, experience, and guidance.**

## For Developers

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Convex (real-time database)
- **Auth:** Clerk (multi-role authentication)
- **Email:** Resend (transactional emails)
- **Deployment:** Vercel

### Complete Setup Instructions

#### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ installed
- npm or yarn package manager
- Git installed
- Accounts needed: Convex, Clerk, Resend (for email), Vercel (for deployment)

#### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ChristianTonny/spark.git
cd spark
```

#### Step 2: Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

#### Step 3: Set Up Convex (Backend Database)

1. Create a Convex account at [convex.dev](https://convex.dev)
2. Install Convex CLI globally (if not already installed):
```bash
npm install -g convex
```
3. Initialize Convex in the project:
```bash
npx convex dev
```
4. This will create a `.env.local` file with `CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL`

#### Step 4: Set Up Clerk (Authentication)

1. Create a Clerk account at [clerk.com](https://clerk.com)
2. Create a new application in Clerk dashboard
3. Go to **API Keys** section
4. Copy your publishable key and secret key
5. Add to `.env.local`:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
```
6. In Clerk dashboard, configure:
   - Enable Email/Password authentication
   - Set up redirect URLs: `http://localhost:3000/auth-redirect`
   - Add custom fields for user roles if needed

#### Step 5: Set Up Resend (Email Service) - Optional for Development

1. Create a Resend account at [resend.com](https://resend.com)
2. Get your API key from the dashboard
3. Add to `.env.local`:
```bash
RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
```
4. For production, verify your domain in Resend dashboard

#### Step 6: Configure Environment Variables

Your `.env.local` file should contain:

```bash
# Convex
CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT=your-deployment-name
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=https://your-convex-url.convex.cloud

# Clerk
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_xxxxxxxxxxxxx

# Resend (Optional for dev)
RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

#### Step 7: Seed the Database (First Time Only)

Run the seed script to populate initial data (careers, assessments, etc.):

```bash
npm run seed
```

Or manually through Convex dashboard by running individual seed files in `/convex`.

#### Step 8: Run Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

#### Step 9: Create Test Users

1. Sign up as a student at `/sign-up`
2. To test mentor features, you'll need to:
   - Apply as a mentor at `/apply-as-mentor`
   - Log in as admin (first user becomes admin)
   - Approve the mentor application in admin dashboard
3. For admin access, the first registered user automatically gets admin role
