# Research: Rwanda Career Database Expansion (Lean)

Goal: build a Rwanda-relevant careers dataset that makes OpportunityMap feel “local” and immediately useful.

## What we need to add (high-priority categories)

- Tourism & Hospitality (tour guides, hotel ops, culinary, event management)
- TVET / Trades (electrical, plumbing, welding, carpentry, automotive, mechanics)
- Health (nursing pathways, lab tech, community health)
- Agriculture & Agri-business (livestock, agronomy, supply chain, food processing)
- Construction & Real Estate (quantity surveying, site supervision, architecture support roles)
- Media & Creative (broadcast, video editing, graphic design, photography)
- Logistics & Transport (fleet ops, warehousing, procurement)
- Public sector & NGOs (program officer, M&E, policy support)
- Finance (accounting, banking, fintech operations)
- Education (teaching pathways, school leadership)

## Data fields we must capture per career (minimum)

- Title + Rwanda-local synonyms
- 2–3 sentence “what you actually do” summary (simple language)
- Typical entry paths (TVET / university / apprenticeship)
- Required skills (technical + soft skills)
- Work environment (team size, pace, location constraints)
- Salary range in RWF (rough, with “ranges are estimates” note)
- Local “where to learn” options (schools/TVETs/programs)
- Local employer types (not necessarily specific companies at first)

## Sources to use (choose the smallest set that’s credible)

- Rwanda TVET program listings and curricula (for trades + pathways)
- Rwanda job boards + internships (for real titles + skill requirements)
- University program catalogs (for formal pathways)
- Short interviews with mentors/students (for what’s confusing or missing)

## Output format for implementation

We will convert this research into:
- A structured list of new careers to seed into Convex
- A structured list of local schools/programs to seed and link from careers

## Next research actions (fast, 1–2 days)

- List 30 careers to add (10 tourism/hospitality, 10 TVET, 10 agriculture/health mix)
- For each: fill the minimum fields above (even if salary is rough)
- Identify 10 local schools/programs to link for those careers
