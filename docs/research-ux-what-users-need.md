# Research: What Students Actually Need (Lean UX Notes)

Goal: make the product useful for real students quickly, without building for imaginary users.

## Core user job-to-be-done

“Help me choose what to study next and what careers to explore, with Rwanda context, without overwhelming me.”

## What to validate (questions for 5–10 students)

1. When you hear “career assessment”, what result would make you trust it?
2. What 3 questions do you always have about a career before you take it seriously?
3. What would make you *save* a career for later?
4. What is your biggest fear about choosing a career path?
5. Which matters more today: salary, stability, interest, or impact? Why?
6. Do you prefer: “top 3 matches” or “show me many options with filters”?
7. Would you book a mentor session? What would make you hesitate?
8. What would you want to know about a mentor before booking?
9. What is missing from existing sources (school counselors, family, online)?
10. If you could change one thing about OpportunityMap, what would it be?

## UX principles for implementation (actionable)

- Careers should be the primary object (not categories).
- Search-first is the default (students don’t browse categories like a catalog).
- Reduce card size and cognitive load; show more options per screen.
- De-emphasize salary early; introduce it after interest/fit to avoid “money-first” bias.
- Remove/avoid contradictory content in career pages; keep 1 clear narrative.
- For booking: no “developer error”. Always explain what the user can do next.

## Metrics to track (simple)

- Assessment completion rate (start → finish)
- Saved careers per student
- Mentor booking request rate
- “Return rate” within 7 days (students coming back to explore)
